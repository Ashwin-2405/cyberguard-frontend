🔗 Architecture Overview

Area - Stack
Frontend - React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Recharts, AI
Backend - Express.js, PostgreSQL, JWT, Bcrypt, Multer
Security - Helmet, CORS, bcrypt, HTTPS-ready config
Dev UX - Modern ESLint, Prettier, modular components
Team Workflow - Clear branch/commit hygiene, full Gitignore

💡 Innovation Highlights

-AI-powered threat summarization enables anyone (even non-technical) to act on log alerts.
-Enterprise sheen in minutes: Componentized UI, loaders with animation, glassmorphism/dark mode.
-Zero friction: No-copy-paste; upload & get results immediately.
-Battle-hardened: Strong error handling, security-first by default, API health checks.

🏆Why CyberGuard Excels for Hackathons

-Immediate Demo Appeal: Judges understand the value within seconds—upload, analyze, view AI callouts.
-Plug & Play Deployment: 1-command for both backend and frontend, cloud ready.
-Team-Ready Repos: Concerns separated, no "it works on my machine" problems.
-Live Session / JWT: Secure and efficient collaboration, not a toy demonstration.
